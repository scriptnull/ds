package arrays

// In computer programming, a dope vector is a data structure used to hold information about a data object,[1] e.g. an array, especially its memory layout.

// A dope vector typically contains information about the type of array element, rank of an array, the extents of an array (range of indices: zero-based, one-based, or in some languages from any integer (even negative) to any integer), and the stride of an array as well as a pointer to the block in memory containing the array elements.
