package arrays

// BitField is a data structure that contains continuous memory sequence storing bits in them
// A bit field is distinguished from a bit array in that the latter is used to store a large set of bits indexed by integers and is often wider than any integral type supported by the language.
// Bit fields, on the other hand, typically fit within a machine word
type BitField byte
