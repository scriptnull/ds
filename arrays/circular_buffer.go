package arrays

// A circular buffer, circular queue, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.
// This structure lends itself easily to buffering data streams.

// Please check adt/queue.go -> ArrQueue for an implementation of this.
