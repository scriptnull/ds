// Control tables are tables that control the control flow or play a major part in program control.
// There are no rigid rules about the structure or content of a control tableâ€”its qualifying attribute is its ability to direct control flow in some way through "execution" by a processor or interpreter.

// Control tables are mostly implemented as  system level data structures, while implementing a new programming language etc.
// In order to implement a control table, we need to implement a interpreter also. Then only the system can know how to use the control table
